# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Implementation

Implemented Dijkstrs's Algorithm using text files inputing information such as the distances between 2 cities, people in the cities, and a start city and end city. Using the algorithm, the program finds the shortest path from the start city to the end city, then it prints out the people visited in each visited city with the highest score.
